\begin_layout Abstract
Pedestrian detection is a key problem in computer vision and is a key element
 in vision systems for autonomous vehicles.
 For autonomous vehicles it is a very important task.
 The main reason is safety.
 The pedestrian detection algorithms were explored widely and thoroughly
 by a wide range of explorers.
 Perhaps the best algorithm that can be found today in the pedestrian detection
 community is the algorithms and open code written by Piotr Dollar, which
 we are going to use in our work.
 However, detecting the pedestrians is just one piece of the puzzle, and
 the other piece is to map the pedestrian in the three dimensional world.
 In this paper we will show our results of working with Dollarâ€™s algorithm
 and our implementation for detecting and mapping.
